# Plugins

These are pure Vue apps that:

1. Are not dependent on Nuxt runtime
2. Have UnoCSS classes, but they're used in the apps so the actual UnoCSS is injected automatically
3. Contain standalone constants, utilities, and types

## Usage

Each plugin can be developed and imported into your Nuxt applications as needed.
